  "description": "South India is known for many things including its temples, cuisine, local dialect and some spectacular dance forms. However, an understated asset of this part of India is its beaches. Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have some of the finest beaches you will see. They are different in terms of their ambiance when you compare them with the beaches of Goa. They have their unique flavor and are every bit as beautiful (if not more) than the beaches in the rest of the country.",
